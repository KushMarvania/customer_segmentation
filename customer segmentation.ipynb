    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Customer segmentation** is a process of dividing customers into groups based on shared characteristics such as demographics, behavior, or purchasing patterns. There are different clustering algorithms that can be used for customer segmentation, each with its advantages and disadvantages. In this case, you want to use K-means, DBSCAN, CRM and LRFM, Fuzzy clustering, and Hierarchical clustering to segment your customers. Let's discuss each of these algorithms briefly:\n",
    "\n",
    "* K-means clustering: This algorithm partitions the data into K clusters, where K is a predefined number. Each data point belongs to the cluster whose mean is closest to it. This algorithm is easy to implement and computationally efficient, but it assumes that clusters are spherical, equally sized, and have similar densities.\n",
    "* DBSCAN: This algorithm groups together points that are close to each other based on a density criterion. Points that are close together and have high density are considered part of the same cluster. This algorithm is robust to noise and can handle arbitrary-shaped clusters, but it requires specifying two parameters: epsilon (the radius around each point) and min_points (the minimum number of points to form a cluster).\n",
    "* CRM and LRFM: These are marketing segmentation methods that use customer behavior and purchasing patterns to group customers into segments. CRM (Customer Relationship Management) focuses on customer interactions with the company, while LRFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) focuses on the frequency, recency, and monetary value of customer purchases.\n",
    "* Fuzzy clustering: This algorithm assigns a degree of membership to each data point to each cluster. A point can belong to multiple clusters with varying degrees of membership. This algorithm is useful when a data point is ambiguous and can belong to multiple clusters.\n",
    "* Hierarchical clustering: This algorithm groups data points into a hierarchy of clusters using a bottom-up (agglomerative) or top-down (divisive) approach. Each data point starts as its cluster, and the algorithm iteratively merges or splits clusters based on a distance criterion. This algorithm can be used to visualize the relationships between clusters at different levels of granularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine which algorithm is best for your customer segmentation task, you can compare their results based on metrics such as cluster validity, interpretability, and computational efficiency. You can also experiment with different parameters and preprocessing steps to optimize the results."

    "# Choosing Number of Clusters\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing the appropriate value of k is an important step in K-means clustering. There are several methods to determine the optimal number of clusters. Here are some common methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Elbow method: This method involves plotting the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) against the number of clusters k and selecting the value of k at the \"elbow\" of the curve, which represents a significant drop in the WCSS. The idea is that as we increase the number of clusters, the WCSS will decrease, but at some point, the marginal decrease in WCSS will become less significant. The elbow point represents the optimal value of k that balances the trade-off between model complexity and clustering performance.\n",
    "* Silhouette score: This method measures the quality of clustering by computing the average distance between each point and its own cluster compared to the average distance to the nearest neighboring cluster. The score ranges from -1 to 1, with higher values indicating better-defined clusters. The optimal value of k corresponds to the highest silhouette score.\n",
    "* Gap statistic: This method compares the within-cluster dispersion for different values of k with that of a null reference distribution generated by randomly shuffling the data. The optimal value of k corresponds to the point at which the gap between the within-cluster dispersion and the null reference distribution is the largest.\n",
    "* Average silhouette width: This method computes the average silhouette score for each value of k and selects the value of k that maximizes the average silhouette width.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, there is no single \"best\" method for choosing k, and different methods may produce different values of k. Therefore, it is recommended to try different methods and compare the results to make an informed decision."

    "* The **Silhouette Coefficient** is calculated using the mean intra-cluster distance (a) and the mean nearest-cluster distance (b) for each sample. The Silhouette Coefficient for a sample is (b - a) / max(a, b). To clarify, b is the distance between a sample and the nearest cluster that the sample is not a part of. Note that Silhouette Coefficient is only defined if number of labels is 2 <= n_labels <= n_samples - 1. This function returns the mean Silhouette Coefficient over all samples. To obtain the values for each sample, use silhouette_samples. The best value is 1 and the worst value is -1. Values near 0 indicate overlapping clusters. Negative values generally indicate that a sample has been assigned to the wrong cluster, as a different cluster is more similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Calinski-Harabasz (CH) Index** (introduced by Calinski and Harabasz in 1974) can be used to evaluate the model when ground truth labels are not known where the validation of how well the clustering has been done is made using quantities and features inherent to the dataset. The CH Index (also known as Variance ratio criterion) is a measure of how similar an object is to its own cluster (cohesion) compared to other clusters (separation). Here cohesion is estimated based on the distances from the data points in a cluster to its cluster centroid and separation is based on the distance of the cluster centroids from the global centroid. CH index has a form of (a . Separation)/(b . Cohesion) , where a and b are weights. Higher value of CH index means the clusters are dense and well separated, although there is no “acceptable” cut-off value. We need to choose that solution which gives a peak or at least an abrupt elbow on the line plot of CH indices. On the other hand, if the line is smooth (horizontal or ascending or descending) then there is no such reason to prefer one solution over others. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Davies-Bouldin score**. The score is defined as the average similarity measure of each cluster with its most similar cluster, where similarity is the ratio of within-cluster distances to between-cluster distances. Thus, clusters which are farther apart and less dispersed will result in a better score. The minimum score is zero, with lower values indicating better clustering."

    "**Principal Component Analysis** is an unsupervised learning algorithm that is used for the dimensionality reduction in machine learning. It is a statistical process that converts the observations of correlated features into a set of linearly uncorrelated features with the help of orthogonal transformation. These new transformed features are called the Principal Components. It is one of the popular tools that is used for exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling. It is a technique to draw strong patterns from the given dataset by reducing the variances.\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA generally tries to find the lower-dimensional surface to project the high-dimensional data.\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA works by considering the variance of each attribute because the high attribute shows the good split between the classes, and hence it reduces the dimensionality. Some real-world applications of PCA are image processing, movie recommendation system, optimizing the power allocation in various communication channels. It is a feature extraction technique, so it contains the important variables and drops the least important variable."

    "In PCA (Principal Component Analysis), the **explained variance ratio** is a measure of how much information (or variance) each principal component captures from the original data. It is the ratio of the variance of a principal component to the total variance of all the principal components. For example, if we have performed PCA on a dataset with 10 features and we have 5 principal components, the explained variance ratio of the first principal component is the ratio of the variance of the first principal component to the sum of the variances of all 5 principal components. The explained variance ratio is a useful metric to evaluate the effectiveness of PCA in reducing the dimensionality of the data. It tells us how much of the original data's variance is retained in the reduced feature set. Higher explained variance ratio for a principal component indicates that it captures more important features of the original data."

    "**Cumulative explained variance ratio** is the sum of explained variance ratios for all the principal components up to a certain point. It is often used in PCA to determine the number of principal components to retain for further analysis. For example, if we have performed PCA on a dataset with 10 principal components, and the explained variance ratios for each component are [0.2, 0.15, 0.1, 0.08, 0.06, 0.05, 0.04, 0.03, 0.02, 0.01], then the cumulative explained variance ratio for the first two principal components would be 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35. Similarly, the cumulative explained variance ratio for the first five principal components would be 0.2 + 0.15 + 0.1 + 0.08 + 0.06 = 0.59. By examining the cumulative explained variance ratio, we can determine the number of principal components to keep for further analysis. Typically, we want to keep enough principal components to capture a large portion of the variance in the data, while also minimizing the number of components to avoid overfitting. A common threshold for determining the number of principal components to keep is to retain enough components to capture 80-90% of the cumulative explained variance."

    "* Decision Tree Classifier: A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure in which each internal node represents a \"test\" on an attribute, each branch represents the outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents a class label. Decision tree classifier is a type of supervised learning algorithm that is mostly used for classification problems.\n",
    "* Random Forest Classifier: Random forest is a type of ensemble learning algorithm that is used for classification, regression, and other tasks. In random forest, we grow multiple decision trees and combine their results to classify new data. Random forests can improve the performance of decision trees by reducing overfitting.\n",
    "* Gradient Boosting Classifier: Gradient boosting is a machine learning technique for regression and classification problems that produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models. It builds the model in a stage-wise fashion like other boosting methods, and it generalizes them by allowing optimization of an arbitrary differentiable loss function.\n",
    "* AdaBoost Classifier: AdaBoost is an ensemble learning method that uses multiple models to improve the predictive performance. AdaBoost works by creating a base decision tree model, then using that model to make predictions on the training data, and then boosting the weights of the training data that were not predicted correctly.\n",
    "* K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier: K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) is a type of instance-based learning or lazy learning where the function is only approximated locally and all computation is deferred until classification. K-NN is used for classification and regression.\n",

    "Performance for each of the model is great, let's consider CatBoost for learning which is dedicated for clustering work.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CatBoost** is an open-source machine learning(gradient boosting) algorithm, with its name coined from “Category” and “Boosting.” It was developed by Yandex (Russian Google ) in 2017. According to Yandex, CatBoost has been applied to a wide range of areas such as recommendation systems, search ranking, self-driving cars, forecasting, and virtual assistants. It is the successor of MatrixNet that was widely used within Yandex products.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take a look at some of the key features that make CatBoost better than its counterparts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Symmetric trees: CatBoost builds symmetric (balanced) trees, unlike XGBoost and LightGBM. In every step, leaves from the previous tree are split using the same condition. The feature-split pair that accounts for the lowest loss is selected and used for all the level’s nodes. This balanced tree architecture aids in efficient CPU implementation, decreases prediction time, makes swift model appliers, and controls overfitting as the structure serves as regularization. \n",
    "* Ordered boosting:  Classic boosting algorithms are prone to overfitting on small/noisy datasets due to a problem known as prediction shift. When calculating the gradient estimate of a data instance, these algorithms use the same data instances that the model was built with, thus having no chances of experiencing unseen data. CatBoost, on the other hand, uses the concept of ordered boosting, a permutation-driven approach to train model on a subset of data while calculating residuals on another subset, thus preventing target leakage and overfitting.  \n",
    "* Native feature support: CatBoost supports all kinds of features be it numeric, categorical, or text and saves time and effort of preprocessing."

It also implements “score_samples”, “predict”, “predict_proba”, “decision_function”, “transform” and “inverse_transform” if they are implemented in the estimator used. The parameters of the estimator used to apply these methods are optimized by cross-validated search over parameter settings. In contrast to GridSearchCV, not all parameter values are tried out, but rather a fixed number of parameter settings is sampled from the specified distributions. The number of parameter settings that are tried is given by n_iter. If all parameters are presented as a list, sampling without replacement is performed. If at least one parameter is given as a distribution, sampling with replacement is used. It is highly recommended to use continuous distributions for continuous parameters."
